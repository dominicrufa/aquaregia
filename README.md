------------

a small library for running simulations and performing machine learning tasks on Molecular Mechanics systems.

an example on how to convert `OpenMM` `System` objects to jax potential energy functions is  [here](https://gist.github.com/dominicrufa/8dfe8d865bc2f33a2fe7870aece7cc6c)
and an example on how to run a simulation with PBCs is [here](https://gist.github.com/dominicrufa/d1aa4acd6fba04356417de73961da075).

The codebase is subject to change.
